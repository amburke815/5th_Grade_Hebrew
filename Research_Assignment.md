# 5th Grade Research Assignment

## Purpose
This year, we will study <i>Tikkun Olam</i>, the Jewish tradition of repairing the world. Some of us may see
Tikkun Olam as being environmentally friendly--picking up trash, recycling, taking quick showers--but Tikkun Olam is an 
even wider concept! <br><br>
Let us consider a wider definition of Tikkun Olam. To repair the world means there's something wrong with it that needs 
fixing. While there is a lot to be grateful for, there are many problems with the world as it is today. Systemic problems
such as global warming, hunger, financial inequality, racial inequality and discrimination, access to healthcare, and 
many others demand some serious Tikkun Olam. <br><br>
As Jewish thinkers, our goal is to delve deep into a specific, systemic issue. We will examine the exact sources of the 
problem, current and proposed solutions, and compare and contrast them with Jewish perspectives across a range of sources.
(See the <a href="requirements">requirements</a> section below). <br><br>
The whole purpose of going to religious school is to grow into responsible, socially conscious Jewish adults, so let's 
start that process now!

## What is a <i>Systemic Issue?</i>
A <b>system</b>ic issue is an issue for which there is a <b>system</b> or systems in place to perpetuate it. For example, if my 
friend is mean to me, that's definitely an issue, but there is probably no system in place that supports them being 
mean to me, and we can resolve it without making changes to society. We will do some case studies in class to make it 
clear how we can identify these systems and understand how they perpetuate an issue. <br><br>
The point of this clarification is to make sure that we are picking <b>BIG</b> issues, not just little problems that can
be easily solved. These problems are difficult! We don't expect you to solve them or even offer a definitive solution--
the process of researching problems and examining multiple solutions is where the learning happens!

## The Project
In this project, you will choose a specific systemic issue to study. You will identify the systems in place that are 
working to make the problem worse or better, study their motivation, and research a spectrum of Jewish interpretations 
and solutions, evaluating the effectiveness of each one.<br><br>
This project will take place over the course of our year together, and you will present it during the last two weeks.
Like everything at religious school, this is <b>not</b> graded. The only evaluation you will get is verbal feedback from your 
teachers and peers, not to mention the satisfaction of completing an advanced research project in 5th grade!
<br><br>
We understand that you have busy lives and have obligations outside of religious school such as sports, arts, and homework!
For that reason, we will give adequate time to complete the assignment in class, but do encourage you to spend extra 
time outside of class if you can spare it! You will learn as much as you put in!<br><br>
If you want to work with a partner, please just ask! We're happy to let you work with a partner, but please know that 
the requirements for your project will be doubled, except for the synthesis piece.
### Requirements <a href="requirements"></a> 
The following is a minimal list of tasks you will complete for this project. Please feel free to add more if you find it 
interesting or rewarding!
<ul>
<li>Formal Problem Statement (1 paragraph or slide)</li>
<li>Interviews 
<ul><li>1 with someone younger than you</li>
<li>1 with someone your age</li>
<li>1 with someone less than 20 years older than you</li>
<li>1 with someone more than 20 years older than you</li>
<li>1 with a Jewish community leader (rabbi, teacher, AERS staff, ... etc)</li></ul></li>
<li>Analysis of 3 Jewish texts and how they relate to your issue. At least one must not be the Torah.</li>
<li>Analysis of current systems in place affecting your problem.</li>
<li>Synthesis Piece: compile your research into a format of your choosing! <ul><li>Explicitly show what the Jewish 
commentary on your issue and possible solutions are.</li>
<li>Evaluate the efficacy of each solution.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

#### About the Problem Statement
Tell us what the specific problem you're studying is! Here is an (incomplete) list of research questions to answer:
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
<li>Why is the problem bad?</li>
<li>What do people think about the problem?</li>
<li>Who/what is causing the problem? Making it worse? Making it better?</li>
<li>Where is the problem the worst? The best?</li>
<li>What is the government doing about this problem? What about foreign governments?</li>
</ul>
Again, these are just ideas. Please do not just go down the list and answer each question in order. Part of the learning
you will do revolves around knowing how to ask you own questions! If you're stuck or need help please feel free to ask!

#### About the Synthesis Piece
By the end of the year, you will be an expert on your specific issue. This part of the project is intended to be a 
fun and interesting way of showing that expertise off to your peers, teachers, and parents. There are no requirements on
the length or size of your synthesis piece, except for that it must show the understanding you gained from each of 
the requirements. For example, you could write a play where the 5 characters are your interviewees, write an essay that
shows off all of their viewpoints, livestream your analysis, the choice is up to you! The goal is to be creative and 
effectively communicate all of your research to your peers.
